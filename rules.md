## Introduction

## Game Play

### Teams
Players sitting opposite each other form a team.

### Card Ranking
The rank of the cards from highest to lowest is: Red Joker, Black Joker, Level Card, Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2.

### The "Level"
Each team has a "level" that they are currently on, starting at 2 and going up to Ace. The card that corresponds to the current level of the declarer team is known as the "level card". For example, if the declarer's team level is 7, the 7s are the level cards for that hand. Level cards rank just below the Jokers and above the Aces. The level cards of the heart suit are wild cards and can be used as any other card (except a joker).

### Dealing
The deal and play are counter-clockwise. For the first hand, one player shuffles and another cuts the deck. The player who cuts the deck turns over a card and the player who receives that card in the deal plays first. In subsequent hands, the winner of the previous hand plays first. Each player is dealt 27 cards.

### Playing the Game
The first player can play any valid card combination. Subsequent players must either play a higher-ranking combination of the same type, a "bomb", or pass. If all three other players pass, the player who played the last combination wins the trick and can lead with any new valid combination.

## Winning and Scoring

The first player to get rid of all their cards is the winner of the hand. The order in which the other players get rid of their cards determines how the winning team's level is affected.

* If the winner's partner also gets rid of their cards before the other team, the winning team is promoted by 3 levels.
* If the winner's partner gets rid of their cards before one of the opponents, the winning team is promoted by 2 levels.
* If the winner's partner gets rid of their cards last, the winning team is promoted by 1 level.

The first team to win a hand while at the "Ace" level wins the game.
